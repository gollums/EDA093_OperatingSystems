+ The **stdin** is redirecting wrong, needs to be fixed before submission in order for commands like *cat*
or *grep* to work. Should be an easy fix and hopefully solve the problem
+ It created some zombies when emacs command ran. Could be fixed with the **stdin** change.
+ Could be a flag missed for dup2.
