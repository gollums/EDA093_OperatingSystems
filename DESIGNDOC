---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please include them here.

>> Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
>> preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course
>> text, lecture notes, and course instructors.
  >> The unix manual in bash (man) and online searches on various sites to
     check what the commands should do in a working shell.

			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
   >> We set days where we programmed together so that both could
      understand what we were doing and if we had different ideas on
      how to tackle the assignment. Total hours spent per person: 12. 

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.
   >> We programmed as a pair so the tasks were not divided as such,
      more than, for example, one found a solution for pipes while
      the other one looked at how to solve the redirection of in and
      out files.


			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
  >> It was a quite different approach then we were used to in other
     laborations, where it has been more of "step-by-step" instructions.
     This resulted in that the start of the assignment went a bit slower
     then we hoped.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?
  >> Have more than one time to do the demonstration, because we had to wait
     about 30 minutes after scheduled time. 

>> Any other comments?
